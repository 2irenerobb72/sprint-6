For my future site if I ever had a video on it I would have the option for
subtitles in English and another language. Also I would also make a transcript
option if the video is long and has a lot of content.

The laws in the US about accessability on a website is that the website
has to have "effective communication" in audio, writing. And that all sites
should be accessable. They also mention that you could have a lawsuit if
you don't apply these rules.
