# Review

Good work on layout, media, and promises. I actually knew Cynthia Waddell back in the day. Haven't heard that name in almost 15 years . . .

Very nice work on the og metadata and the Twitter cards. These will be very useful if you build your own website and want people to see it. Sadly, if you're not on Twitter and Facebook these days, you've lost 90% of your audience already.

Don't forget to include both `node_modules` and `jspm_packages` in your `.gitignore` file so you do version other people's code. (You had `doe_modules` -- tired?)

The tic-tac-toe code looks good. Don't forget to strip out any test code before you "deploy". (The console still says "hi" to me.)

Good work! Looking forward to seeing you in Wellington.
