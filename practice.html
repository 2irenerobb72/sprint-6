      <h2>Articles</h2>
      <p>
        The HTML Article Element represents a self contained composition in a
        document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
        independently distributable or reusable. This could be a forum post, a
        magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other
        independent item of content.
      </p>
      <h2>Asides</h2>
      <p>
        The HTML aside element represents a section of the page with content
        tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that
        content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts.
        They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions
        from the glossary.
