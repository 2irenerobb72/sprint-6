-I promise to make links easily visible to see in normal text with a different
color and an underline.
-I promise to use descriptive text for the link so the viewer will know what
the link is going to and whether they want to use or not.

I will always change color of the links for when they are used and unused; blue
and purple. I also will have the link underlined. I will assume the assumptions
of the viewer with: putting the expected content in easily seen areas,
having a good page heading, linking in the correct way and having an image that
relates to your site.

to prevent link rot:
I will only use essential links
I will link to pages more than PDFs
And I will use links that are more direct
