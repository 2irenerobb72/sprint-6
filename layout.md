I have used a lot of this CSS already while watching and doing practices on
team treehouse and codeschool. I have used box-model and width, margin, position,
floats, overflow and display. Something that I have not used before is clear,
box-sizing. I tried both out on a simple example page with paragraphs, links and
a picture.
